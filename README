kiaki - filter text into kde input action keyboard input string

DESCRIPTION
    In kde.. if you open kde control center -> Regional & Accessibility ->
    Input Actions

    You can do some cool stuff. I like the input actions. I have a shortcut
    now that only works for a gnome terminal. It makes it go to cd ~/devel,
    clears the screen, and shows which packages are checked out from cvs.
    Awesome. Took me an hour to get working, and it's going to save me that
    extra second of typing, it will add up. I am glad I have it. Thing is..

    To use kde input actions.. You have to enter the stuff in a funny
    awkward way. A string of text as if the keyboard were typing it. So that
    for the shortcut to type out "These Are Things", you have to freaking
    manually enter:

       Shift+T:H:E:S:E:Space:Shift+A:R:E:Space:Shift+T:H:I:N:G:S:Enter

    Yeah. Forget that. Here's the alpha version of kiaki. A unix filter that
    will transform text input into those goofy kde input action strings.

    Spaces, tabs, carriage returns, should be entered as is, they will be
    translated. Being a unix filter, it takes stdin and spits to stdout.

    kiaki, acronym for Kde Input Actions Keyboard Input.

USAGE
    kiaki [OPTIONS]..

       -h           help

  EXIT CODE
    If we can translate all characters, we print the string to stdout and
    exit 0. If we cant't recognize a string, we convert the ones we can,
    issue warnings and leave unchanged ones we cannot, and exit with true
    error code.

  USAGE EXAMPLES
       $ echo "These would be letters..\nEnteredls" | kiaki
       Shift+T:H:E:S:E:Space:W:O:U:L:D:Space:B:E:Space:L:E:T:T:E:R:S:.:.:\:N:Shift+E:N:T:E:R:E:D:L:S:Enter

TODO
    This script could do more, like automatically edit the kde config so the
    action is entered via the cli instead of the crappy gui.

  Example entry
    This makes Ctrl-d send a terminal to ~/devel.. etc
